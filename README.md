This site was developed as a univerisity project for the exam "Linguaggi e Programmazione per il Web". The project was developed entirely by me and a colleague of my university course. 
We were given complete freedom as long as we'd develop a functioning site complete with front-end graphics and back-end interactions, so we came up with the idea of a music coaching site, meant to be sort of a "hub" for frontal lessons.
The site is divided in different sections based on the instrument the user is interested in, thus suggesting only pertinent lessons divided by skill level. Completing each lesson increases your ranking and can be seen and compared with other people's ranking on a leaderboard system, meant to encourage friendly competition and improvement of individual skills.
The site was meant to host a social section but it ended up being too much content for a simple university project, but I might expand the idea one day.

The project scored a 27 out of 30 on evaluation.
